*Overview of the Project
*Project- Simple Calculator

*Objective
The objective of the program is to create a simple calculator application in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The program will:Prompt the user to input two numbers.Ask the user to choose an arithmetic operationPerform the selected operation on the input numbers.Display the result of the calculation to the user.

*Key Activities
Input Collection:Prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).Prompts the user to select an operation by entering the corresponding number.
Operation Selection:Displays the available operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).Reads the user's choice.
Performing the Operation:Executes the selected mathematical operation based on the user's input.Handles division by zero to avoid runtime errors.
Output Display:Displays the result of the selected operation.Provides feedback for invalid choices.
Program Termination:Closes the Scanner object to release resources.

*Technologies Used
Java Programming Language: Core language for creating the application.
Scanner Class: For reading user input from the console.
Control Flow Statements: switch and if statements for logic branching.
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, / for mathematical calculations.
Error Handling: Basic handling of invalid inputs and division by zero.

*Key Insights

User Input Handling:The program uses a Scanner object to take user inputs for numbers and operation choice.It ensures dynamic input handling, allowing users to specify any double-precision numbers.
Operation Selection:The user is presented with a menu to choose an operation, ensuring clarity and simplicity.
Control Flow:A switch statement handles the operation selection, providing clear and concise decision-making.Division by zero is explicitly handled to prevent runtime errors.
Error Handling:Invalid inputs for operation selection and division by zero are managed with user-friendly error messages.
Flexibility:The program can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, making it versatile for basic calculations.
Readability and Usability:Clear prompts and messages ensure ease of use for the end user.
